## Questions to ask Dr. Anderson

1. While the functionality of the project seems to be well described, it is hard to understand the content of each source file. For example,your GitHub repository consists of 3 .c files (msgrcv_lwr.c, msgsnd_pr.c, system5_msg.c); however, the project prompt asks to have 2 .c files (searchmanager.c and system5msg.c). Is there any way you can briefly describe how each of these files are used?
